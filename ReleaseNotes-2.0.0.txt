This is Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks - version 2.0.0

This is the largest change since 1.1.0 more than ten years ago!
The game now uses SDL2 and have a more keyboard, game pad and even touch friendly design!

Compared to the old 1.4.2 a number of changes:
* Uses SDL2. This means textures and sprites instead of old surfaces.
* New config file format
* TTF font support
* Translation support (includes a Danish translation)
* New keyboard and game controller friendly menu system
* Better behind the scenes handling
* Build by a CMake system
* Location of saved games changed in Linux
* Better game controller support (although limited to SDL2 supported controllers)
* Better mouse play
* More modern icon
* Linux saves are now stored under $HOME/.local/share/blockattack 

Some known regressions:
* It is not possible to store replays
* There are no network support.

The new back-end will allow it to be implemented smarter in the future. The old version was too difficult to use anyway. 

Some regressions that will not be fixed:
* Only SDL2 supported game controllers are supported
* Old config and some saves are lost then converting to 2.0.0+
