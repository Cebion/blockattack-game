This is Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks - version 2.0.1

This is a small bugfix release that fixes 2 bugs:
 * The "Get Ready" animation used the wrong sprite
 * My homepath was hardcoded in the Makefile (Linux only)

Known problems:
 * Resolution is still fixed at 1024x768
 * Fonts are messed up in some rare cases (opserved on a Windows 10 machine with High DPI)
